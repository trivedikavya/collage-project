            <h2>1. AIM</h2>
            <p>To perform basic file and folder operations like creating, deleting, renaming, moving, adding content, and deleting content using Command Prompt.</p>

            <h2>2. THEORY</h2>
            <p>The Command Prompt (CMD) is a command-line interpreter in the Windows operating system. It allows users to execute commands to perform various tasks, including managing files and directories. Common commands used for file and folder operations include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>mkdir</code>: To create folders</li>
                <li><code>del</code>: To delete files</li>
                <li><code>rmdir</code>: To delete folders</li>
                <li><code>rename</code>: To rename files or folders</li>
                <li><code>move</code>: To move files or folders</li>
                <li><code>echo</code>: To add content to files</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>These commands are integral for automating tasks, managing file systems, and enhancing productivity.</p>

            <h2>6. CONCLUSION</h2>
            <p>This project of Kavya Trivedi demonstrates how to use Command Prompt for basic file and folder operations. The commands covered include creating, deleting, renaming, moving, and editing files and directories. These operations are essential for effective file system management and can also be automated for repeated tasks.</p>
